# Construction AI Assistant

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered conversational assistant specialized for the construction industry. It leverages advanced AI to provide expert guidance on structural engineering, project management, safety protocols, building codes, and best construction practices.

The assistant answers questions such as:
- Proper concrete mix ratios for foundations.
- How to calculate load capacities for steel beams.
- Required safety measures for working at heights or excavation.
- The process of obtaining building permits.
- Advantages of different insulation and construction materials.
- Scheduling and managing commercial construction projects.
- Common causes of structural failures.
- Step-by-step safety procedures for excavation and other tasks.

## Code Description

The main script `construction_ai.py` does the following:

- Uses the Gradio library to create an interactive web interface where users can type construction-related questions.
- Displays example questions in the interface as clickable templates for user convenience.
- Captures user input and processes it through an AI backend (e.g., OpenAI API) to generate knowledgeable, construction-specific responses.
- Provides buttons to submit questions, clear the chat, and manage the conversation history seamlessly.
- Outputs AI-generated responses in a chat-like format for easy reading.
- Contains clearly defined functions handling interaction events, such as message submission and clearing chats.
- Includes a footer message emphasizing the assistantâ€™s specialization and advising professional consultation for critical decisions.

## API Key Configuration

The AI functionality requires an API key for authentication. To configure:

1. Open `construction_ai.py`.
2. Find the line defining the API key, e.g.:

   ```python
   API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
   ```
3. Replace `"your_api_key_here"` with your actual API key string.
4. Save and run the script.

**Note:** Keep your API key secure and never expose it in public code repositories.

Alternatively, if environment variables are used for the API key, set the appropriate system environment variable (e.g., `GROQ_API_KEY`) before running the app.

## Installation

- Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
- Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install gradio requests
  ```

- Run the application:

  ```bash
  python construction_ai.py
  ```

- Access the interface via the displayed local web address.

## Usage

- Input construction questions into the provided text box.
- Use example questions by clicking to auto-fill the input box.
- Submit queries to receive AI-generated answers.
- Clear conversations anytime using the clear button.

## Important Notes

- This assistant provides helpful guidance specific to construction industry topics.
- It is not a substitute for licensed engineers or official inspections.
- Always verify critical construction decisions with qualified professionals.
